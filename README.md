special-draw
============

special-draw is a very small pebble library that lets you draw rotated and/or semi-transparent primitives and text.

Installation
------------

```
pebble package install special-draw
```

You must be using a new-style project; install the latest pebble tool and SDK
and run `pebble convert-project` on your app if you aren't.

Usage
-----

Usage is quite simple:

1. Begin the special-draw procedure.
2. Draw whatever primitives/text you'd like to.
3. Add modifiers to achieve the desired effect.
4. End the special-draw procedure.

It should be noted that special-draw is a relatively
cpu-heavy operation and takes about 24kb of memory.
For this reason, it's generally better to use
alternatives such as GPath when possible.

### Example

```c
graphics_draw_rect(ctx, GRect(32, 54, 80, 60));

// Begin the session.
GSpecialSession * session = graphics_context_begin_special_draw(ctx);

graphics_draw_rect(ctx, GRect(42, 64, 80, 60));

// Add modifiers as desired.
graphics_context_special_session_add_modifier(session, graphics_special_draw_create_opacity_modifier(GOpacity2));
graphics_context_special_session_add_modifier(session, graphics_special_draw_create_rotation_modifier(TRIG_MAX_ANGLE / 100));

// End the session.
graphics_context_end_special_draw(session);
```

The above code requires no further cleanup since special-draw instances are
automatically destroyed after use.

### API

#### Base API

`GSpecialSession * graphics_context_begin_special_draw(GContext * ctx)`

>Begins a special-draw session. You must keep the returned pointer to the
    `GSpecialSession` as it is used to end the session.

`void graphics_context_end_special_draw(GSpecialSession * session)`

>Ends this `GSpecialSession` and destroys the associated data structure,
    including all modifiers.
>You must call this exactly once for every special-draw session opened.

`void graphics_context_special_session_set_compositing_mode(GSpecialSession * session, GCompOp compositing_mode)`

>Change the compositing mode used by the default draw
    implementation. This may not be honored by custom draw
    modifiers. Defaults are `GCompOpSet` for color and
    `GCompOpAnd` for B/W screens.

>This is usually not necessary for color screens. See **Caveats**
    below for more information on compositing modes for B/W
    screens.

>Default for B/W: `GCompOpClear`, Default for 6+2-bit color: `GCompOpSet`

#### Modifier API

`void graphics_context_special_session_add_modifier(
        GSpecialSession * session, GSpecialSessionModifier * modifier)`

>Add a modifier to the internal list of modifiers.

>Note that there can only be one `draw`-type modifier, and
>attempting to add more will replace (and destroy) the
>previous one.
>(currently, the only effect that requires a draw-type modifier is rotation.)

### Included Modifiers

#### special-draw-rotation.h

`GSpecialSessionModifier * graphics_special_draw_create_rotation_modifier(
    int32_t angle)`

>Creates a rotation modifier. This is a `draw`-type modifier.

- Mixing a dithered opacity setting such as `GOpacity1_5`
    with a rotation that is not a multiple of 90 degrees
    will lead to weird interference.
- Arbitrary center points for rotation are currently not
    supported. (this is low-hanging fruitâ€”feel free to submit
    a pull request!)

#### special-draw-opacity.h

`GSpecialSessionModifier * graphics_special_draw_create_opacity_modifier(
    GOpacity opacity);`

>Not supported on Aplite.

>Creates an opacity modifier. This is a normal-type modifier.

Choose an opacity from this enum:

```c
    typedef enum {
        GOpacity0,
        GOpacity0_5,
        GOpacity1,
        GOpacity1_5,
        GOpacity2,
        GOpacity2_5,
        GOpacity3
    } GOpacity;
```

0: completely invisible (somewhat pointless) to 3: fully visible

Intermediate stages lead to (checkerboarded) dithered
transparency. This may lead to disappearing or
dashed diagonal lines.

### Making your own modifier

Modifiers get full access to the GBitmap which
primitives were rendered to, and draw-type modifiers
also get access to the GContext (as they are supposed
to draw the GBitmap to the GContext.)

Modifiers are a struct, defined in special-draw.h, with the
following structure:

```c
(GSpecialSessionModifier) {
    bool overrides_draw;
    union {
        GSpecialSessionModifierCallback modifier_run;
        GSpecialSessionModifierDrawCallback modifier_draw;
    } action;
    void * context;
    GSpecialSessionModifierDestroyCallback destroy;
}
```

A pointer to this structure should be passed to
`graphics_context_special_session_add_modifier`.

If `overrides_draw` is true, `modifier_draw` must be set.
Otherwise, `modifier_run` must be set.

This is a bare-bones modifier example:

```c
#include "special-draw-opacity.h"

static void prv_run_modifier(GSpecialSessionModifier * modifier,
        GBitmap * session_bitmap) {
    // Insert bitmap manipulation code here.
}

static void prv_destroy_modifier(GSpecialSessionModifier * modifier) {
    free(modifier->context);
    free(modifier);
}

GSpecialSessionModifier * graphics_special_draw_create_pointless_modifier() {
    GSpecialSessionModifier * mod = malloc(sizeof(GSpecialSessionModifier));
    mod->overrides_draw = false;
    mod->action.modifier_run = prv_run_modifier;
    mod->destroy = prv_destroy_modifier;
    mod->context = malloc(sizeof(uint8_t));
    *((uint8_t *) mod->context) = 42;
    return mod;
}
```

Caveats
-------

- Nesting `GSpecialSession`s is not supported and probably
    won't be due to the high memory requirements.
- Settings apply to the entire `GSpecialSession`, not just
    the part drawn after they are applied.
- Since the B/W framebuffer does not natively support
    transparency, it it **not** possible to draw a mixed
    black-and-white image on B/W screens using this library.
    - The created framebuffer is completely filled with black
    on these platforms, and you may want to use
    `graphics_fill_rect` to fill it with white for certain
    `GCompOp`s.
    - `GCompOpClear` (the default), for example, lets you draw in 
    white and [effectively] maps black -> transparent and
    white -> black.
